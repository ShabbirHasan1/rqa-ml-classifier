# Stock Price Direction ML Classifier

This repository contains various classifier models that predict the direction in which Apple's stock price will move the next day. Each model outputs a binary outcome:
* 1 --> the stock price increased
* 0 --> the stock price decreased/didn't change

This project is an attempt to replicate the findings (in Chapter 2) of a whitepaper written by Bin Weng.
